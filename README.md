# A simple extension for Firefox that activates Reader Mode

It toggles the Reader Mode and informs the user if it isn't possible. The possibility or not depends on the website.

## Support

Needs Firefox 58+ to work.

Chromium and other browsers not yet supported. Probably never will.

## Future

I might try add support for some sites that clearly could benefit from this feature. But there is a limit, I guess.
